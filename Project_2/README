I. Requirements:

Part 1 - System Calls:
	We need to implement system calls and exception handling. We need to complete the implementation of exisintg skeletal 
calls Fork, Exec, Exit, and Yield. The Fork and the exec are to be done for multi-programming to be implemented. 
Also, we need to make some system calls skeletons for which have not been provided yet. These are system calls for the Lock 
class Acquire() and Release() methods and the Condition Variable class Wait(), Signal(), and Broadcast() functions.Also, we need  to 
implement constructor and destructor system calls to create a Lock and a Condition object. These are to be called: CreateLock,
DestroyLock, CreateCondition, DestroyCondition. The CreateLock and CreateCondition system calls can either take no argument, 
or can be set a name through a character array parameter. When calling CreateLock or CreateCondition, we are to return an 
integer value. This value is an index position into a kernel structure array of actual Lock and Condition Variable objects. The user 
program sees it as an identifier that is somehow associated by you (in the kernel of Nachos) with the kernel-level Lock, 
or Condition Variable, object that you created. These returned numbers can then be used by user program to Acquire and Release Locks; 
and with Condition class' Wait, Signal, and Broadcast functions. For the DestroyLock and DestroyCondition system calls, they take a single integer parameter - 
the identifier for the Lock or Condition Variable kernel object that is to be deleted.				

Demonstrate that all system calls perform correctly, when used in any combination and cannot be used to break the OS. 
Ensure not only that proper input to the calls work properly, but that improper input is captured and dealt with appropriately.
In no case should Nachos terminate abnormally.

Part 2 - Multiprogramming:
In this part, the objective is to enable Nachos to run multiple user programs simultaneously. We need to:
	-- Come up with a way of allocating physical memory frames so that multiple programs can be loaded into memory at once.
	-- Provide a way of copying data to/from the kernel from/to the user's virtual address space (now that the addresses 
	the user program sees are not the same as the ones the kernel sees)
	-- Complete the implementation of the Exec and Fork system calls
	-- Nachos Exec creates a new address space and starts a single thread running that code. You can think of it as a 
	combination of Unix fork and exec.
	-- Demonstrate that Exec and Fork perform correctly, when used in any combination and cannot be used to break the OS. 
	Ensure not only that proper input to Fork and Exec work properly, but that improper input is captured and 
	dealt with appropriately. In no case should Nachos terminate abnormally.

The value returned by the CreateLock system call - so the OS can use that argument (cast appropriately to a Lock 
pointer in kernel mode) to get to the Lock object created in CreateLock.

Part 3 - 
 Implement part 2 of project 1, Movie theatre, as a set of multithreaded Nachos user programs. We ought to use the new Lock
and Condition Variable system calls that you implemented in part 1 for synchronization; and the Fork system call to
create all threads. Using Exec syscall, we need to have multiple movie theatre simulations, each running independently, executed through different processes simultaneously.

We are to provide a test suite to proves our implementation is correct. We must fully explain what Locks and Condition
 Variables we use in your solution and how it guarantees proper synchronization between the threads in your tests. These
 tests should be equivalent to the set of tests you had for your simulation in project 1 part 2.
				
II. Assumptions:

	-- The total number of Physical Pages of memory we use is 4096. For that, we are changing the variable NumPhysPages in machine.h file to be 4096.
	-- Our program allows for 250 locks and an equal number of Condition Variables (CVs) at the max
	-- Once a lock has been requested to be deleted, we shall entertain no new requests to acquire it
	-- Once a CV has been requested to be deleted, we shall service no requests for Signal or Wait or Broadcast
	-- Our program allows for a maximum of 150 threads to be forked
	-- Exec can be used to spawn a maximum of 10 new execution streams
	-- Our print statement can handle a max input string of 100 chracters. And once, number of %d in that string have gone past 
		three, we no longer can print numbers (as nachos only allows 4 arguments to a syscall), so we simply print %d there
	-- For movie theatre simulation: assumptions are same as that of Project 1
	-- The STACK_FENCEPOST in thread.h was shifted further my increasing the "StackSize" macro to 8 KB.

III. Design:

Parts 1 and 2:

For implementing Locks and CVs :

We are using Kernel Lock structures and Kernel CV structures:

For kernel locks:

typedef struct _KernelLocks
{
    Lock *lock;
    AddrSpace *currentAddrSpace;
    YES_NO inUse;
    YES_NO isGoingToBeDeleted;
    int isGoingToBeUsed;
}KernelLocks;

typedef struct _KlCb
{
    KernelLocks kl[MAX_LOCKS];
    Lock *kLock;
    int nextLockLocation;
    char kLockName[20];
}KlCb;
KlCb klCb;

enum YES_NO
{
	YES=2,
	NO=3
};

typedef struct _KernelCVs
{
    Condition *cv;
    AddrSpace *currentAddrSpace;
    YES_NO inUse;
    YES_NO isGoingToBeDeleted;
    int isGoingToBeUsed;
}KernelCVs;

typedef struct _KcvCb
{
    KernelCVs kcv[MAX_CVS];
    Lock *kLock;
    int nextCVLocation;
    char kLockName[20];
}KcvCb;
KcvCb kcvCb;


The enum YES_NO is defined so as to use to store whether a particular lock is in use.

Locks:
The lock variable is actual Lock class object used as part of our Lock creation syscall. The inUse variable is set to YES to show if it has been created and is availble for Acquire and Release calls. nextLockLocation variable tells us at what index the next available lock can be found. The variable isGoingToBeDeleted is set to YES once a request to delete has been received. The kLock kernel lock is used to ensure multiple threads/processes do not modify lock data structure simultaneously. 

Condition Variables - CVs:
The cv variable is actual Condition class object used as part of our CV creation syscall. The inUse variable is set to YES to show if it has been created and is availble for Wait, Signal and Broadcast calls. nextCVLocation variable tells us at what index the next available CV can be found. The variable isGoingToBeDeleted is set to YES once a request to delete has been received. The kLock kernel lock is used to ensure multiple threads/processes do not modify CV data structure simultaneously. 


To begin with, once it has been established that we shall be running a userprogram - the section under #USER_PROG in main.cc
 calls the functions initailizeKlCb and initializeKcvCb - which set up our KlCb and KcvCb structures.

void initializeKlCb()
{
    int i = 0;
    sprintf(klCb.kLockName, "%s","KernelLock\0");
    klCb.kLock = new Lock(klCb.kLockName);
    klCb.nextLockLocation = 0;
    for(i=0; i< MAX_LOCKS; i++)
    {
        klCb.kl[i].lock = NULL;
        klCb.kl[i].inUse = NO;
		klCb.kl[i].lock = NULL;
		klCb.kl[i].currentAddrSpace = NULL;
        klCb.kl[i].isGoingToBeUsed = 0;
        klCb.kl[i].isGoingToBeDeleted = NO;
    }
}

The above function initializes our set of locks. 

void initializeKcvCb()
{
    int i = 0;
    sprintf(klCb.kLockName, "%s","KernelLock\0");
    kcvCb.kLock = new Lock(kcvCb.kLockName);
    kcvCb.nextCVLocation = 0;
    for(i=0; i< MAX_CVS; i++)
    {
        kcvCb.kcv[i].cv = NULL;
        kcvCb.kcv[i].inUse = NO;
		kcvCb.kcv[i].cv = NULL;
		kcvCb.kcv[i].currentAddrSpace = NULL;
        kcvCb.kcv[i].isGoingToBeDeleted = NO;
        kcvCb.kcv[i].isGoingToBeUsed = 0;
    }
}


This function initializes our control block of CVs. These two functions are run as soon as it is established that a user 
program will be run on nachos.

Design of the System Calls
---------------------

The userprograms, in test directory have included syscall.h. This header file has the isgnature for our system calls. Once such 
a function is encountered in the user program, it is mapped to relevant exception handling device in the exception.cc file 
through the assembler code in start.s. Once in that switch statement in ExceptionHandler function of the exception.cc, the 
requisite code can be executed.

	-- CreateLock(char *) and CreateCV (char *)
		
		Under this system call we'll setup a lock, or CV, and return a number for the lock, or CV,  to the user program.
		The userprogram can name the lock, or CV, by passing a character pointer as argument. The functions will check if next
		location of lock or CV (which is incremented by 1 everytime a new one has been created) has reached MAXIMUM allowed 
		value or not (MAX_LOCKS or MAX_CVS). If it hasnt and the next location is valid number (ie a whole number), it shall
		proceed to check if associated lock, or CV, (i.e., one with the index number equal to value of next location) is in 
		initalized state. If that is so, then it will set it up - putting inUse variable to 1 and associated addr space in data structure
		with current process and create a new Lock. If those values werent found to be in an initialised state, then we use findfreelock(), 
		or findfreeCV, function to find the available lock or CV with smallest possible index by going through entire array. 

	-- AcquireLock (int)
	
		This system call will attempt to acquire the Lock created by a CreateLock statement. The user program will send an integer as
		argument to this system call. This syscall will first acquire a kernel lock for manipulation of the global data structure
		KlCb. Next up we validate that argument. We check if that lock number is in use and the current process had setup the lock
		and we have had no request to delete that particulr lock number. If we had a non-valid input we show requisite error message.
		If it wasnt in use we print lock hasnt been created, if current process doesnt own, then we give related error message
		and if a request for deletion had already been sent, we would not allow it to be acuired, as per ur asssumption. With
		each acquire request we increment counter for isGoingToBeUsed.
		
	-- ReleaseLock (int)
	
		Here also the userprogram shall send an integer as argument. And again, after acquiring kernel lock we will first validate the
		input before calling Lock->Release on the lock object in the data structure. On successful release, our lock::release
		function in thread directory returns a 1. Once we get that we decrement isGoingToBeUsed counter. If it now becomes zero
		then we shall check if a request for its deletion has been received by system earlier, If so, we get rid of it by setting all
		values to initialization time parameters. The validation on the input number being correct is same as it for acquire 
		lock and so are the error messages.
		
	-- DestroyLock (int)
	
		Once again the user program must send an argument specifying lock index and we shall validate it after acquiring kernel lock.
		If the GoingToBeUsed value is non-zero, ie more Acquire requests than executed release requests, we dont delete but simply save
		the message by setting the ToBeDeleted value. If that isnt the case we delete it and reclaim the index number. The 
		number is then assigned to next Lock that is created.
		
	-- WaitCV (int lockId, int cvId) and SignalCV(int lockId, int cvId)
		
		Here we pass two arguments, the first signifies the lock number to be accessed and the second the CV number. After acquiring 
		kernel lock to access the global data structure we validate both inputs. The lock number is checked for first. The 
		validation is same as it was for Lock alone. Then we check for CV index value - this must also be validated like lock.
		So we check if it is in use, the current process is owning process and that no request for deletion has been made.
		Depending on which validation is failed, we print relevant message. In case of WaitCV, if there was no error, we  increment to
		be used value release kernel lock, and call wait. In case of SignalCV, we get reurned a value of 1 if Signal was successful and 
		then we decrement to be Used value and release kernel lock. If after Signal the value for the isToBeUsed is set as 
		zero, than we go delete the CV.
		
	-- DestroyCV (int)
	
		Here we only pass CV number. This is similar to lock, as in the deletion is not carried out if there pending sleepers.
		But the variable isToBeDeleted is set. Differently, if there are no pending sleepers, we delete CV.
		
		
Memory Management
------------------

	Running a new user program - 
	
	To enable multiprogramming we have modified Start Process function (in /userprog/progtest.cc file) to begin with - its
	called when a userprogram begins executing. We define it as a new process and give it the next available process id. Since
	this is a new program we set the existing thread as main thread.

				
			Process *proc = new Process(space);
			
			int nextProcessID = proc -> GetProcessID();
			
			if(nextProcessID == -1)
			{	
				return;
			}
			
			processTable[nextProcessID] = proc;
			
			currentThread -> AssignProcess(nextProcessID);
			
			proc -> SetMainThread(currentThread); 
			proc -> IncrementChildThreadCount();

	
	Changes have also been made to the ***** AddrSpace Constructor**** to enable new address space creation for new process and 
										--------------------------------
	new stack space for evry child thread in that process space.
	
	The constructor now looks thus:
	
		AddrSpace::AddrSpace(OpenFile *executable) : fileTable(MaxOpenFiles) 
		{
			NoffHeader noffH;
			unsigned int i, size;

			// Don't allocate the input or output to disk files
			fileTable.Put(0);
			fileTable.Put(0);
			
			addrSpaceLock = new Lock("pageTableLock");

			executable->ReadAt((char *)&noffH, sizeof(noffH), 0);
			if ((noffH.noffMagic != NOFFMAGIC) && 
				(WordToHost(noffH.noffMagic) == NOFFMAGIC))
				SwapHeader(&noffH);
			ASSERT(noffH.noffMagic == NOFFMAGIC);

			size = noffH.code.size + noffH.initData.size + noffH.uninitData.size ;
			stackStart = divRoundUp(size, PageSize); // store the start of the stack for the current thread
			numPages = stackStart + divRoundUp(UserStackSize,PageSize);
														// we need to increase the size
								// to leave room for the stack
			size = numPages * PageSize;
			
			
			ASSERT(numPages <= NumPhysPages);		// check we're not trying
								// to run anything too big --
								// at least until we have
								// virtual memory

			DEBUG('a', "Initializing address space, num pages %d, size %d\n", 
							numPages, size);
		// first, set up the translation 
			pageTable = new TranslationEntry[numPages];
			
			int nextAvailablePage = 0;
			
			for (i = 0; i < numPages; i++) 
			{
				pageTable[i].virtualPage = i;	// for now, virtual page # = phys page #
				
				bitMapLock -> Acquire();
				nextAvailablePage = bitMap -> Find();
				if(nextAvailablePage == -1)
				{
					printf("\nNachos ran out of memory\n");
					interrupt -> Halt(); // Halt nachos and exit 
				}
				bitMapLock -> Release();
				pageTable[i].physicalPage = nextAvailablePage;
				
				if(stackStart == i)
				{
					stackStart = nextAvailablePage;
				}
				
				pageTable[i].valid = TRUE;
				pageTable[i].use = FALSE;
				pageTable[i].dirty = FALSE;
				pageTable[i].readOnly = FALSE;  // if the code segment was entirely on 
							// a separate page, we could set its 
							// pages to be read-only
							
				// zero out the physical page that is being copied. The index is multiplied with page size as the mainMemory is a character array.
				//bzero(&(machine->mainMemory[nextAvailablePage * PageSize]), PageSize);
				
				// read the executable page by page and copy it to the main memory.
				executable -> ReadAt(&(machine -> mainMemory[nextAvailablePage * PageSize]), PageSize, noffH.code.inFileAddr + (i * PageSize));
			}
			
			
			// we'll use the last page mapped to find the stack pointer and put that in StackReg
			lastPhysicalPageMapped = nextAvailablePage;
		}
	
	Exec Syscall
	-------------
	
		This syscall is to create a new Process. We create new process and give it a process ID. The addrspace is defined
		through the construct in the file progtest.cc as described above. The name of the executable along with the path and the lemgth of the 
		path string is passed to it. The signature of the call looks like -- SpaceID Exec_Syscall(char *executableFile, int length)

		
		In exception.cc file we assign the Parent proces as well. 
			
		
			int parentProcessID = currentThread -> GetParentProcess();
			
			proc -> SetParentProcess(parentProcessID);
			
			processTable[nextProcessID] = proc;
	
			Thread *processMainThread = new Thread("ProcessMainThread");
			processMainThread -> space = newProcessSpace;
			proc -> IncrementChildThreadCount();
			
			processMainThread -> AssignProcess(nextProcessID);
			

			processMainThread -> tcb -> SetStackStart(newProcessSpace -> stackStart);
			
			Process *parentProcess = processTable[parentProcessID];
			
			parentProcess -> IncrementChildProcessCount(nextProcessID);
			
			processMainThread -> Fork((VoidFunctionPtr) Exec_Thread, 0);
	
		
		A new stack has to be setup. For this we use the function we have created in the file /userprog/ThreadControl.h. 

			void ThreadControlBlock :: SetStackStart(int pageNumber)
			{
				stackPageStart = pageNumber;
			}
		
		The argument to be passed is passed through addrspace.cc file, which uses stackStart function (from the addrSpace file)
		to compute the value where the stack for the main thread of the system starts. 
		
		
		And once we have setup the addrSpace we go ahead and use Thread::Fork function to define our new process with the given
		address Space. Below is the relevant function - void Exec_Thread(int inner)
		
			currentThread -> space -> SetDefaultStack();			

			currentThread -> space -> InitRegisters();
			currentThread -> space -> RestoreState();
			
			machine->Run();
			
		The Page table for process is setup using ResizePageTable() function in the AddrSpace file. A bitmap lock is acquired,
		which is a kernel variable defined in system.cc, so as to get an unused physical page of memory that we use in the
		page table. The function stores the current page table in a temprary memory and increases the size of the page table
		on demand. New pages are added to the pageTable of the process if it spawns a new thread The relevant algorithm is as
		follows:

		int AddrSpace :: ResizePageTable()
		{
			addrSpaceLock -> Acquire();
			//create a new temporary page table and add a physical page entry to it
			TranslationEntry *tempPageTable = pageTable;
			
			int numberOfStackPages = UserStackSize / PageSize;
			
			// increase the size of the page table to 
			pageTable = new TranslationEntry[numPages + numberOfStackPages];
			
			for(int idx = 0; idx < numPages; idx++)
			{
				//copy back the priginal contents of the page table
				pageTable[idx] = tempPageTable[idx]; 
			}
			
			int pgIdx = 0;
			
			// add the stack pages to the page table
			for(int Idx = 0; Idx < numberOfStackPages; Idx++)
			{	
				pgIdx = numPages + Idx;
				
				if(pgIdx >= NumPhysPages)
				{
					printf("Nachos ran out of memory\n");
					interrupt -> Halt();
				}
				
				pageTable[pgIdx].virtualPage = pgIdx;	
				
				bitMapLock -> Acquire();
				int nextAvailablePage = bitMap -> Find();
				bitMapLock -> Release();
				
				if(nextAvailablePage == -1)
				{
					printf("\nNachos ran out of memory\n");
					interrupt -> Halt(); // Halt nachos and exit 
				}
				pageTable[pgIdx].physicalPage = nextAvailablePage;
				pageTable[pgIdx].valid = TRUE;
				pageTable[pgIdx].use = FALSE;
				pageTable[pgIdx].dirty = FALSE;
				pageTable[pgIdx].readOnly = FALSE;  // if the code segment was entirely on 
							// a separate page, we could set its 
							// pages to be read-only
							
				// zero out the physical page that is being copied. The index is multiplied with page size as the mainMemory is a character array.
				//bzero(&(machine->mainMemory[nextAvailablePage * PageSize]), PageSize);
			}
			
			// increment the size of the table to include the newly added pages for the stack. 
			
			numPages += numberOfStackPages;
			
			addrSpaceLock -> Release();
			
			// return the last stack top address back to the exception handler to write to StackReg.
			return pgIdx * PageSize;
		}

				
		We check for maximum Processes allowed in our Process.cc file. And if nachos runs out of space by being unable to find a
		unused physical memory, the error message is displayed - "Nachos has run out of memory." We make the simultiaon Halt()
		if it so happens.
			
	Fork Syscall
	-------------
	
		For Fork syscall, we only need to give new Thread a brand new stack, that is 8 pages in size. No new address space is created. Here also, actual thread generation uses Thread::Fork() function. 
		To begin with we check if the new request takes our thread count beyond limit. If it is so, we refuse to service the 
		request for forking and simply return by displaying a message that too many threads have been forked and no more 
		allowed.
		
	
		void Fork_Syscall(unsigned int vaddr, unsigned int vaddrName)
		{
			char *threadName;		// buffer for output

			if ( !(threadName = new char[NameSize]) ) {
				printf("%s","Error allocating kernel buffer for write!\n");
				return;
			} 
			else 
			{
				if ( copyin(vaddrName,NameSize,threadName) == -1 ) 
				{
					printf("%s","Bad pointer passed to to write: data not written\n");
					delete[] threadName;
					return;
				}
			}
			int parentProcessID = currentThread -> GetParentProcess();
	
			Process *parentProc = processTable[parentProcessID];
			totalFork++;
	
			if (totalFork > MAX_THREAD)
			{
				printf("\n\nYou have forked too many new threads. No more are allowed.");
				//interrupt->Halt();
				return;
			}
			else
			{
				Thread *newThread = new Thread(threadName);
				delete []threadName;
				// allocate the address space to the new kernel thread. This will be the address space of the parent process and hence will be copied from  

				newThread -> space = currentThread -> space;
				// assign the new thread to the parent process
				DEBUG('x',"A new thread was created; It is named - %s\n",newThread->getName());
				newThread -> AssignProcess(parentProcessID);
				//increment the childcount of the parent process
				parentProc -> IncrementChildThreadCount();
				// create a kernel level thread. pass the virtual address to the kernel thread
				newThread -> Fork((VoidFunctionPtr) Kernel_Thread, vaddr);
			}
		}
		
		
	Exit Syscall (int ExitStatus)
	-------------		
		
		The Exit syscall is being run considering three cases:
		
		Case 1:
		
		The thread to be terminated is the last executing thread in the last process in Nachos. In this case, we simply call
				interrupt -> Halt();
				
		Case 2:
		
		The thread calling quits is neither the last executing thread in process, nor is this the last process in Nachos.
		We release the stack pages for this thread, where valid bit is true. We use Bitmap::Clear function for that.
		
		Case 3:
		
		The thread calling exit is the last executing thread in a process, but not the last process in nachos. So Nachos isnt
		going to stop. We do the following
			-- We clear out all the valid entries in the page table
			-- We release all locks and CVs that were setup for that process
		
		
		Code is thus:
		
		       int processID = currentThread -> GetParentProcess();
        Process *proc = processTable[processID];

        proc -> DecrementChildThreadCount();

        if(ProcessCount == 1) // this is the last process of the
        {
                if(proc -> ChildThreadCount() == 0)
                { // this is the last thread of the last executing process
                        ProcessCount--;
                        DEBUG('e',"\nLast process Exiting\n");
                        MemClear(1); // clear the memory for the process
                        freeCVHeldByProcess(currentThread->space); // reclaim kernel resources
                        freeLockHeldByProcess(currentThread->space);
                        interrupt -> Halt();
                }

        }
        else
        {
                int childCount = proc -> ChildThreadCount();

                if(childCount > 0) // there are still mor children of the process
                {
                        MemClear(0); // reclaim the pages for stack for this thread
                }
                else if(childCount == 0) // last child of this process
                {
                        ProcessCount--;
                        DEBUG('e',"\n Clearing the memory for the thread %x", currentThread);
                        MemClear(1); // reclaim all the pages allocated to the process

                        freeCVHeldByProcess(currentThread->space);// reclaim kernel resources, i.e Locks and CVs
                        freeLockHeldByProcess(currentThread->space);
                }

		void MemClear(int option) //this funciton is to reclaim memory
		{
        // if option is 1 then we will clear the entire memory allocated to the process
        // else we just need to clear the stack pages allocated to the thread

        if(option == 1) // main thread of the process has exited
        {
                // restore the page table so that machine copies the current page table enteries

                currentThread -> space -> ReclaimPhysicalPages();
        }
        else // only the stack pages need to be deleted
        {
                currentThread -> space -> RemoveThreadStack();
        }
		}


		
		
Part 3 : Movie Theater Simulation(s)
------------------------------------

		The algorithms in the simulation are same as they were in Project 1. 
		
		The mapping of our Locks and CVs constructs into syscalls are as follows:

		For implementation we have used some trifle modifications to make it possible:
		
			-- Instead of enum for our states of different entities, we have used #define and integer values to specify states.
	
			-- we have used a printLock (using system calls to generate it) in user program so as to ensure that when more than 
				3 numbers are to be printed, we can combine two print syscalls as we need to and yet avoid a race condition, 
				wherein two different statements might overlap
		
For Extra Credit - More Syscalls
--------------------------------
	
	Other than requisite system calls we have implemented these extra calls. These have been tested separately
	 or within different test cases.
	
	
	-- void Print(char* , int, int, int) :
		This system call is being used to print the input string character-by-chracter. Since we are printing chracter-by-character, 
		we have print lock to ensure multiple threads do not overwrite each other. We can print 3 numbers at a time using time
		as we dont take length as input. The maximum size is 100. And once, number of %d in that string have gone past 
		three, we no longer can print numbers (as nachos only allows 4 arguments to a syscall), so we simply print %d there.
	
	-- int Scan() :
		This system call is used to scan input from the console input, 1-digit at a time  - this returns a
		number that is equal to the difference in Ascii value of '0' and the input variable. 
	
	-- int Random() :
		This system call is used to return a random number generating using the random() function. 

	-- void PrintTab() :
		This system call prints a tab, ASCII value \t, on the console output.

	-- void newLine() :
		This system call prints a new line, ASCII value \n, on the console output.

V. Testing
		
	To compile all tests at once, please run :
	
			make matmult (from /test/ directory)
		
	1. matmult :
	
	+ How to test:
	
		To compile this test separately, run:
				make matmult (from /test/ directory)
		
		To run this test, run:
		
				nachos -x ../test/matmult -d x (from the userprog directory)
	
		This is a given test which checks if the changes for creation of a new stack work like they should. This also tests 
		the print statement with maximum number of integer inputs - 3 numbers. 
		
		This test also covers our Exit syscall in addition to being a test for memory and Print().
	
	+ Test output: 
		The output for this test is the value of each particular number in the resultant matrix. By printing the three numbers
		 in the value we also see that print statement is working fine.

		To compile this test separately, run:
				make locktest (from /test/ directory)
		
		To run this test, run:
		
				nachos -x ../test/locktest -d x (from the userprog directory)
	
		This test shows that an error message is shown if we try to acquire or release locks, that had not created prior. It
		also shows that once destroy has been called once we do not service any new AcquireLock request.
		
		Syscalls used in this test are CreateLock, AcquireLock, ReleaseLock, DestroyLock, Print, and NewLine

		To run this test, run:
		
				nachos -x ../test/locktest2 -d x (from the userprog directory)
	
		Here we check for our release and destroy related validations in a situations where multiple threads were spawned using
		the Fork system call. We use calls to Yield to ensure that Lock_0 is acquired first by thread t1_t1. So thread t1_t2,
		always goes to sleep, till Lock_0 is released. In that time t1_t1 also acquires lock_1. And subsequently destroys itt.
		So, it is never available for thread t1_t2.
		
		Test covers the syscalls - Fork, Yield, AcquireLock, ReleaseLock, DestroyLock, NewLine, Print and Exit
		
	+ Test output: 
		The output for this test display requisite messages showcasing our validations - locks once deleted dont have any

		To compile this test separately, run:
		
		make cvtest		
	
		To run this test, run : 

		nachos -x ../test/cvtest -d x (from the userprog directory)
		
		This test shows that CVs are created by our program and Wait and Signal work correctly. Wait ensures main thread goes to
		sleep till we signal it from test1 thread. And since thread test2 is created only after we have sent signal, it sleeps 
		infinitely since no signal is sent thereafter. Signal is not stored in memory.
		
		Syscalls used in this test - Fork, Exit, Print, CreateLock, AcquireLock, ReleaseLock, WaitCV, SignalCV
		
	+ Test Output	
	
		 Lock_0 is created and is named Lock 0.

		To compile this test separately, run:
				make cvtest2 (from /test/ directory)
		
		To run this test, run:
		
		nachos -x ../test/cvtest2 -d x (from the userprog directory)

		Here we test the broadcast and destroy syscalls for CVs. The broadcast brings two threads off from wait whereas
		destroy deletes the locks once a broadcast has been made and they come out of wait. Since CV is destroyed, the new
		request from main thread isnt serviced. Also, we are running the statements in a loop yet only the first cv is created
		everytime. This ensures that the lowest possible CV number is always set up

		Syscalls used in this test - Fork, Exit, Yield, Print, CreateLock, AcquireLock, ReleaseLock, WaitCV, CreateCV, SignalCV, BroadcastCV and DestroyCV.

		We create CVs in a for loop. When we run out of CVs a message is shown. Since -1 is returned then, the wait on lock 0 is initiated due to the wait for +1 construct, which earlier used to produce an error. This test will show us that 
		limit on CV creation is working.

	9. breakExec
	
	+ How to test:
	
		To compile this test separately, run:
				make breakExec (from /test/ directory)
		
		To run this test, run:
		
		nachos -x ../test/breakExec -d x(from the userprog directory)
		
		We run multiple exec statements to try and spawn more than 10 processes using a for loop that runs 100 times
		We get error statement that maximum available processes exceeded and it is not done. The for loop is 
		executing the locktest file.
		
		Syscalls used in this test are Exec, CreateLock, AcquireLock, ReleaseLock, DestroyLock, Print, and NewLine
		
	+ Test Output: (We get a lot of prints for processes exceeded. Then we get the few processes that are run.)

	15. Movie Theatre Simulation - Running One through exec syscall:
	
		We shall run 2 of our movie theatre simulation with 40 customers, 5 ticket clerks, 5 concession clerks, 3 ticket
		takers, 1 movie technician and 1 manager.
		
			This tests all our sys calls.

		
	+ How to test:
	
		To compile this test separately, run:
				make movietheature1 (from /test/ directory)
		
		To run this test, run:
		
			nachos -x ../test/movietheature1 (from /userprog/ directory)
		
		
	+ Test Output

		The output is similar to what we get for running a single execution.
	

	16. Movie Theatre Simulation - 2 simultanously through 2 exec syscalls:
	
		We shall run 2 of our movie theatre simulations with 40 customers, 5 ticket clerks, 5 concession clerks, 3 ticket
		takers, 1 movie technician and 1 manager.

		This tests all our sys calls.

		
	+ How to test:
	
		To compile this test separately, run:
				make movietheature2 (from /test/ directory)
		
		To run this test, run:
		
			nachos -x ../test/movietheature2 (from /userprog/ directory)
		
		
	+ Test Output

		The output is similar to what we get for running a single execution, albeit for two simulations we have more
		prints.


	17. Movie Theatre Simulation - 3 simultanously through 3 exec syscalls:
	
		We shall run 3 of our movie theatre simulations with 40 customers, 5 ticket clerks, 5 concession clerks, 3 ticket
		takers, 1 movie technician and 1 manager.

		This tests all our sys calls.

VI. Discussion:

    + Experiment expectation.  

		We expect all our syscalls to run smoothly, within their limitations. Testcases should demonstrate that.
				
		We expect our movie theater simulation to run two instances separately successfully.
		
		
	+ Experiment result.  
		
		The expected behavior is seen in all of our testcases.
			
		We were able to successfully able to run 2 instances of our movie theatre simulation we made in Project 1.
		
        
	+ Explanation

		Our implementations are correct.
